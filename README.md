## Name: SHARAN S
## Register Number: 212224040309
## Aim: 
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
Experiment: Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:

Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.
Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).
Generative AI applications.
Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.

## Algorithm:
Here are the steps of the process:

1. **Define Structure** – Decide main sections (Introduction, Fundamentals, Applications, Challenges, etc.).
2. **Collect Content** – Write concise explanations under each section.
3. **Organize Flow** – Arrange sections in a logical order (general → specific → future → conclusion).
4. **Format Content** – Add headings, subheadings, bullet points, and spacing for neat presentation.
5. **Generate PDF** – Use a tool/library (e.g., ReportLab in Python) to compile and export as PDF.


## Output
